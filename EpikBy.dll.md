@Bypass **Version 1.5.0 (*HUGE UPDATE*) is now out! Still Private Of Course**

This Version has some insane stuff. I got into one of Fortnite’s Unreal Engine Test Project’s

Read the Patch Notes below

**Patch Notes**

> **Ability to load in small ``Test Fortnite Projects`` Epic’s working on**

> **Ability to Change things in the Project *Localy* “for now”** (In other words it won’t effect what gets uploaded to Fortnite’s Servers) **This is 100% illegal**

> **Custom Launcher for replaying alter’d Replay Network Packets (Read https://canary.discordapp.com/channels/213757071160508417/736064660289093713/749865738566762506 for more context but in short (Let me explain what’s happening in the video (Video link: https://streamable.com/a25u9d) so as you can see I’m changing characters, it may look like all I’m doing is changing from one player to another but what I’m really doing is controlling the Athena Character with an Module I’m building that’s why the movement is “Bouncy”, so far I can:
Pickaxe Builds, Players, Objects etc))**

> **Custom DLL Injecter** This version introduces a Custom DLL Injecter to suit the needs for us to use our ``EpikBy.dll``
